1. passing correct field name to the ResumeTextDetail instead of using key from the fetch json data (Do this Next!!! Partially complete)

2. making a component for compossing the details in ResumeTextDetail. i want to group certain details.

3. hiding certain details like profile pic url, checkboxes value, variable which hold the count of certain field. ✓

4. placing certain field in consecutive order like instBoard, instBoard1, instBoard2 ✓

* Dynamic :-

qualification fields // degName, inst name, board, marks
company fields // companyName, compPost, joinDate, lastDate, workEx,
skill fields // skillName, skillSource, skillEx,


logic: ✓
step 1: know the value of these variable : qualificationField, workField, skillField
step 2: add these containers "qualificationDetails, companyDetails, skillDetails" as many time as the previous value of the variable.
step 3: marge all details containers in order.
step 4: delete empty fields
